Format of CSV data file:
columns = ['ID', 'Reason for Absence', Date', 'Transportation Expense', 'Distance to Work', 			'Age', 'Daily Work Load Average','Body Mass Index', 'Education', 'Children',
			'Pets', 'Absenteeism Time in Hours']

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files for training of the data:

1- project_preprocessing.py :
Preprocessing the data in above format, creating dummy variables for 'Reason for Absence'
and 'Education', extracting month and day of the week from 'Date' column. Output the preprocessed data in CSV format.

2- project_ml.py :
Scaling the data (output of project_preprocessing.py) except for dummy variable columns, shuffling and splitting the data into train and test parts with 80%-20% ratio, creating and training a Logistic Regression model with train data, (deleting the useless features after training once), testing the model on test data, creating a table including all features and their corresponding weights and the intercept of the model, saving the model and the scaler into files

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files for creating a module to re-use the model on data with no output:

1- absenteeism.py :
Recreating the above preprocess for new data, loading the scaler and model obtained from 'project_ml.py', scaling the data using the same scaler as the one for old data, using the model on the data to predict the targets: excessive absenteeism of an employee.

2- test.py :
using the 'absenteeism' module mentioned above to get the targets of new data
